# PyTorch Version Compatibility Fix

## Problem
The project was encountering errors related to PyTorch version compatibility:
1. `module 'torch.serialization' has no attribute 'add_safe_globals'`
2. Issues with model loading due to attempting to use methods that don't exist in PyTorch 2.0.1

## Root Cause
The code was written to handle PyTorch 2.6+ security changes, but the project is using PyTorch 2.0.1 which doesn't have these features.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Version Checking
Updated `src/utils/patch_torch_safe_globals.py` to:
- Check the PyTorch version before attempting to apply patches
- Skip patching for PyTorch versions < 2.6 where it's not needed
- Check for method existence before calling `add_safe_globals`

### 2. Improved Fallback Mechanisms
Updated all model loading locations with version-aware fallback approaches:
- **FastAPI Startup Event** (`src/api/fastapi_anomaly_api.py`)
- **Video Processing Utility** (`src/utils/process_video.py`)
- **Streamlit Dashboard** (`src/dashboard/integrated_anomaly_dashboard.py`)

Each location now:
1. Checks the PyTorch version
2. Uses appropriate loading method for that version
3. Provides fallbacks for different scenarios
4. Handles exceptions gracefully

### 3. Backward Compatibility
The solution maintains backward compatibility by:
- Working with PyTorch 2.0.1 (current version)
- Preparing for future upgrades to PyTorch 2.6+
- Providing clear error messages and fallbacks

## Key Features

### Version-Aware Patching
The enhanced patch now:
- Detects PyTorch version automatically
- Only applies patches when needed (PyTorch 2.6+)
- Gracefully handles missing methods

### Smart Model Loading
Model loading now:
- Adapts to the available PyTorch version
- Uses context managers when available (`safe_globals`)
- Falls back to standard loading for older versions
- Provides detailed logging for troubleshooting

### Graceful Degradation
- Clear error messages about what's happening
- Fallback mechanisms for different scenarios
- Application continues to run even with partial model loading

## Files Modified

1. `src/utils/patch_torch_safe_globals.py` - Enhanced version checking
2. `src/api/fastapi_anomaly_api.py` - Added version-aware loading in startup event
3. `src/utils/process_video.py` - Added version-aware loading for all models
4. `src/dashboard/integrated_anomaly_dashboard.py` - Added version-aware loading for all models

## Verification
The solution handles different PyTorch versions properly while maintaining all existing functionality. The system should now work correctly with PyTorch 2.0.1 without the previous errors.
