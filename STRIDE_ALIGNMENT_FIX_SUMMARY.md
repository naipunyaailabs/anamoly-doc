# Stride Alignment Fix Summary

## Problem
The system was generating warnings like:
```
WARNING imgsz=[720, 407] must be multiple of max stride 32, updating to [736, 416]
```

This occurred because YOLO models require input dimensions to be multiples of 32 for optimal performance with their convolutional architecture.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `align_to_stride` Function
- **Location**: `src/core/logic_engine.py`
- **Purpose**: Align frame dimensions to multiples of the model's max stride (32)
- **Approach**: 
  - Calculate new dimensions by rounding up to the next multiple of 32
  - Preserve aspect ratio by scaling proportionally
  - Return scale ratios for coordinate mapping if needed
- **Benefits**: 
  - Eliminates YOLO model warnings
  - Maintains aspect ratio as much as possible
  - Works with any input resolution

### 2. Updated Model Functions
- **Functions**: `safe_track_model` and `safe_predict_model` in `src/core/logic_engine.py`
- **Changes**: 
  - Integrated stride alignment before model inference
  - Ensured imgsz parameters are also stride-aligned
  - Added comprehensive comments explaining the necessity

### 3. Consistent Application Across Components
- **API Service**: `src/api/fastapi_anomaly_api.py`
- **Video Processor**: `src/utils/process_video.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed manual resizing logic that was causing issues
  - Integrated calls to `align_to_stride` function
  - Simplified frame processing pipeline

## Technical Details

### Why Stride Alignment is Necessary
YOLO models use convolutional layers with specific stride requirements:
- Maximum stride is typically 32
- Input dimensions must be multiples of 32 for optimal performance
- When dimensions aren't multiples of 32, models automatically adjust them
- This can cause slight distortions and inefficiencies

### How Our Solution Works
1. **Calculate Target Dimensions**: Round up width and height to next multiple of 32
2. **Preserve Aspect Ratio**: Scale frame proportionally to new dimensions
3. **Return Scale Information**: Provide scale ratios for coordinate mapping
4. **Ensure Compatibility**: All model inputs are now stride-aligned

### Example Transformation
- **Input**: 720×407 frame
- **Process**: 
  - Width: 720 → 736 (next multiple of 32)
  - Height: 407 → 416 (next multiple of 32)
- **Output**: 736×416 frame with scale ratios (1.022, 1.022)

## Verification
Created and ran `test_stride_alignment.py` which confirmed:
- All test cases pass stride alignment requirements
- Dimensions are properly multiples of 32
- Scale ratios are calculated correctly
- Works with various input resolutions

## Benefits
1. **Eliminates Warnings**: No more "must be multiple of max stride" warnings
2. **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any video resolution
3. **Maintains Quality**: Preserves aspect ratio and minimizes distortion
4. **Performance**: Optimal model performance with aligned inputs
5. **Robustness**: Consistent implementation across all components
