# PyTorch Safe Globals Patch Fix Summary

## Problem
The previous implementation had issues with the PyTorch safe globals patch because:
1. The `WorldModel` class was not available in `ultralytics.nn.tasks` as expected
2. YOLO-World is installed separately and has its models in a different module
3. The patch was too rigid and didn't handle missing attributes gracefully

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Patch Utility
Updated `src/utils/patch_torch_safe_globals.py` with:
- Graceful handling of missing attributes using `hasattr()` checks
- Support for both `ultralytics.nn.tasks` and `yolo_world` modules
- Fallback mechanisms for different model class locations
- Better error reporting and logging

### 2. Fallback Loading Mechanisms
Updated all model loading locations with fallback approaches:
- **FastAPI Startup Event** (`src/api/fastapi_anomaly_api.py`)
- **Video Processing Utility** (`src/utils/process_video.py`)
- **Streamlit Dashboard** (`src/dashboard/integrated_anomaly_dashboard.py`)

Each location now:
1. Tries to load models with safe globals first
2. If that fails, applies specific patches and tries again
3. Provides clear error messages and warnings
4. Continues execution even if some models fail to load

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added specific exception handling for each model type
- Implemented graceful degradation (document detection can be disabled while other models continue working)
- Added detailed logging to help with debugging

## Key Features

### Safe Globals Detection
The enhanced patch now:
- Checks for `PoseModel` in `ultralytics.nn.tasks`
- Checks for `DetectionModel` in `ultralytics.nn.tasks`
- Checks for `WorldModel` in both `ultralytics.nn.tasks` and `yolo_world`
- Checks for `YOLOWorld` in `yolo_world`
- Only adds available models to the safe globals list

### Fallback Loading
When safe globals loading fails:
- Temporarily adds required classes to safe globals using `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals()`
- Uses specific patches for each model type
- Provides clear warnings about the fallback method being used

### Graceful Degradation
- If document detection fails, it's disabled but other models continue working
- Clear user messages about which features are available
- Application continues to run even with partial model loading

## Files Modified

1. `src/utils/patch_torch_safe_globals.py` - Enhanced patch utility
2. `src/api/fastapi_anomaly_api.py` - Added fallback loading in startup event
3. `src/utils/process_video.py` - Added fallback loading for all models
4. `src/dashboard/integrated_anomaly_dashboard.py` - Added fallback loading for all models

## Verification
The solution handles the PyTorch 2.6+ security changes while maintaining backward compatibility and providing clear error messages for troubleshooting.
