# YOLO-World Model Loading Issue Resolution

## Problem
The error "Can't get attribute 'WorldModel' on <module 'ultralytics.nn.tasks'" indicates that the ultralytics version being used is too old to support YOLO-World models, which require the WorldModel class.

## Root Cause
The Dockerfile was pinning ultralytics to version 8.0.192, which does not include the WorldModel class needed for YOLO-World models.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Dockerfile
- Changed `ultralytics==8.0.192` to `ultralytics>=8.1.0` to ensure YOLO-World model compatibility
- This allows the Docker container to install a version of ultralytics that supports WorldModel

### 2. Created Requirements File
- Added a root-level requirements.txt with all dependencies including the updated ultralytics version
- This ensures consistent dependency management across environments

### 3. Updated Setup Configuration
- Modified setup.py to reference the new requirements.txt file
- This ensures proper package installation when using pip install

### 4. Error Handling
- All existing code (FastAPI, process_video.py, dashboard) already has proper error handling for model loading failures
- The applications will gracefully disable document detection if the model cannot be loaded

## Verification Steps

1. Rebuild the Docker image:
   ```
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. Test document detection by processing a video with documents

## Additional Notes

- The YOLO-World model (yolov8s-worldv2.pt) is a specialized model for open-vocabulary object detection
- It requires a more recent version of ultralytics (8.1.0 or higher) to function properly
- All existing error handling in the codebase will continue to work, gracefully degrading if the model cannot be loaded

## Files Modified

1. Dockerfile - Updated ultralytics version requirement
2. requirements.txt - Created new requirements file with updated dependencies
3. setup.py - Updated to reference new requirements file
