# YOLO-World Model Loading Issue Fix

## Problem
The error "Can't get attribute 'WorldModel' on <module 'ultralytics.nn.tasks'" indicates that the ultralytics version being used is too old to support YOLO-World models, which require the WorldModel class.

## Root Cause
The ultralytics version was too old (likely < 8.1.0) to support the WorldModel class needed for YOLO-World models.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Requirements Files
- Recreated [src/config/requirements.txt](file:///C:/CognitBotz/crowd/src/config/requirements.txt) with the correct format and `ultralytics==8.1.0`
- Created root-level [requirements.txt](file:///C:/CognitBotz/crowd/requirements.txt) for consistency

### 2. Updated Setup Configuration
- Modified [setup.py](file:///C:/CognitBotz/crowd/setup.py) to reference the correct requirements file path

### 3. Verified Docker Configuration
- Confirmed that [Dockerfile](file:///C:/CognitBotz/crowd/Dockerfile) already had the correct ultralytics version (8.1.0)

### 4. Added Documentation and Test Scripts
- Updated [README.md](file:///C:/CognitBotz/crowd/README.md) with troubleshooting information
- Created [test_yolo_world_fix.py](file:///C:/CognitBotz/crowd/test_yolo_world_fix.py) to verify the fix

## Verification Steps

1. Rebuild the Docker containers:
   ```
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Start the application:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. Test document detection by processing a video with documents

## Files Modified

1. [src/config/requirements.txt](file:///C:/CognitBotz/crowd/src/config/requirements.txt) - Recreated with correct format and version
2. [requirements.txt](file:///C:/CognitBotz/crowd/requirements.txt) - Created for consistency
3. [setup.py](file:///C:/CognitBotz/crowd/setup.py) - Updated to reference correct requirements file path
4. [README.md](file:///C:/CognitBotz/crowd/README.md) - Added troubleshooting information
5. [test_yolo_world_fix.py](file:///C:/CognitBotz/crowd/test_yolo_world_fix.py) - Created to verify the fix

## Additional Notes

- The YOLO-World model (yolov8s-worldv2.pt) is a specialized model for open-vocabulary object detection
- It requires ultralytics version 8.1.0 or higher to function properly
- All existing error handling in the codebase will continue to work, gracefully degrading if the model cannot be loaded
