# Removal of Separately Installed YOLO-World

## Problem
The project was using a separately installed YOLO-World package from GitHub, which created complexity and potential conflicts with the main ultralytics package.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed YOLO-World Installation from Dockerfile
- Commented out the lines that clone and install YOLO-World from GitHub
- Kept only the main ultralytics package installation

### 2. Updated Patch Utility
- Removed all references to the separate `yolo_world` module
- Simplified the patch to only work with `ultralytics.nn.tasks`

### 3. Updated All Model Loading Locations
- Removed imports and references to the separate `yolo_world` module
- Simplified fallback mechanisms to only use `ultralytics.nn.tasks`

## Files Modified

1. `Dockerfile` - Removed YOLO-World installation commands
2. `src/utils/patch_torch_safe_globals.py` - Removed yolo_world references
3. `src/api/fastapi_anomaly_api.py` - Removed yolo_world references in fallback code
4. `src/utils/process_video.py` - Removed yolo_world references in fallback code
5. `src/dashboard/integrated_anomaly_dashboard.py` - Removed yolo_world references in fallback code

## Benefits

- ✅ Simplified dependency management
- ✅ Reduced potential conflicts between packages
- ✅ Cleaner codebase
- ✅ Easier maintenance
- ✅ More reliable model loading

## Verification

The system should now work with only the main ultralytics package, using the YOLO-World models (like yolov8s-worldv2.pt) that are included in the standard ultralytics distribution.
