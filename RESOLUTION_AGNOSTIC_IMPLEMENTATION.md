# Resolution-Agnostic Video Processing Implementation

## Overview
This implementation makes the video processing pipeline resolution-agnostic, allowing it to handle any input video size or aspect ratio without errors. The system dynamically adjusts to different resolutions while maintaining accurate detection and visualization.

## Key Features

### 1. Aspect Ratio Preservation
- Videos are resized while maintaining their original aspect ratio
- Padding is added to achieve consistent model input dimensions (640x640)
- Original proportions are preserved to avoid distortion in detection

### 2. Dynamic Resolution Handling
- The system automatically adapts to any input resolution
- No hardcoded size constraints that could break with uncommon aspect ratios
- Consistent preprocessing pipeline regardless of source video dimensions

### 3. Accurate Coordinate Mapping
- Bounding boxes and keypoints are scaled back to original dimensions
- Annotations are correctly placed on the full-resolution output
- Visualizations maintain spatial accuracy across all resolutions

## Implementation Details

### Core Functions in `logic_engine.py`

1. **resize_frame_with_aspect_ratio()**
   - Resizes input frames while preserving aspect ratio
   - Ensures dimensions are multiples of 32 (YOLO requirement)
   - Adds gray padding to achieve consistent 640x640 input size
   - Returns scale ratio and padding information for coordinate mapping

2. **scale_boxes_to_original()**
   - Maps bounding boxes from resized coordinates back to original dimensions
   - Removes padding effects and applies inverse scaling
   - Clips coordinates to stay within frame boundaries

3. **Enhanced Model Functions**
   - `safe_track_model()` and `safe_predict_model()` now handle imgsz parameter properly
   - Automatically adjust image sizes to multiples of 32
   - Provide fallback mechanisms for different model requirements

### Processing Pipeline Updates

All three main components have been updated:
- `process_video.py` (standalone utility)
- `fastapi_anomaly_api.py` (API service)
- `integrated_anomaly_dashboard.py` (Streamlit dashboard)

Each component now:
1. Captures original frame dimensions
2. Resizes frames with aspect ratio preservation
3. Processes resized frames with consistent model inputs
4. Maps detection results back to original coordinates
5. Draws annotations at full resolution for accurate visualization

## Benefits

1. **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any video resolution or aspect ratio
2. **Accurate Detection**: Maintains detection quality regardless of input size
3. **Consistent Performance**: Standardized model inputs ensure stable performance
4. **High-Quality Output**: Full-resolution visualizations preserve detail
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases and unusual formats

## Technical Notes

- All dimensions are adjusted to multiples of 32 to satisfy YOLO model requirements
- Padding uses neutral gray color (114,114,114) to minimize interference with detection
- Coordinate transformations are mathematically precise to maintain annotation accuracy
- Memory usage is optimized by processing at consistent intermediate resolution
